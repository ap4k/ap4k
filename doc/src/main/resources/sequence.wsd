title How AP4K works

participant Compiler as c
participant Processor as p
participant Session as s
participant Handler as h

opt processing phase
    c->+p: annotated classes
    p->+s: start session
    p->+s: register handler
    p->+s: register config
end


opt generation phase

    c->+p: notify processing over
    p->+s: close
    s-->+s: apply configurators
    s-->+s: generate config
    s->+h: send config
    h->+s: generate model
    s-->+s: apply docorators
    s->+p: write to file

end
